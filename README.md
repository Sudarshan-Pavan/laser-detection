Laser Detection
Overview

This project implements a Laser Detection System using Python, designed to detect and identify laser sources in various environments. The system leverages image processing techniques to identify laser light in different conditions, making it suitable for applications in surveillance, security, and industrial automation.
Features

    Real-time Detection: The model processes frames in real time, quickly identifying laser sources.
    Image Processing Techniques: Includes advanced filtering and image processing methods to accurately detect laser light.
    Scalability: Adaptable for different camera feeds and lighting conditions.
    Performance Metrics: Evaluates detection accuracy and speed, optimizing for efficient processing.

Project Structure

    Laser Detection.py: Main Python file containing all the code for laser detection, including image processing functions, configuration, and result output.
    README.md: Project documentation to guide users on setup, execution, and customization.

Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    OpenCV: For image processing
    NumPy: For numerical computations
    Additional libraries as specified in requirements.txt.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Sudarshan-Pavan/laser-detection.git

Install dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the detection script with the following command:

bash

python Laser\ Detection.py

    Input: Accepts live camera feed or pre-recorded video files.
    Output: Displays real-time feedback with marked laser sources in the frame.

Performance

The project focuses on achieving high detection accuracy with low latency, making it suitable for applications where speed is critical. Future work can improve scalability and adaptability for different lighting environments.
Future Improvements
